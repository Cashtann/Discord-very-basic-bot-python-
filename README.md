# Discord-very-basic-bot-python-
Very simple Discord bot, if you just download the code it won't work, you have to read Discord Developer Portal https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro and make your own app, then copy key, and other things. This bot is really stupid, it was rather a joke for my discord server with friends.
