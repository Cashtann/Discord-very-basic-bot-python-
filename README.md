# Discord-very-basic-bot-python-
Discord very simple bot, if you just download the code it won't work, you have to read Discord Developer Portal https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro and make your own app, then copy key, and other things. Better watch tutorial, and remake my code to make it up to you. This bot is quite different, becouse there are some stupid commands you don't want on your discord server, if you want to play music, you have to download it and place in a specific folder. I hope you are not dumb enough, and you know you have to host the bot first.

I hope you Enjoy!
