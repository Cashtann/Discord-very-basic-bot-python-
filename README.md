Disclaimer: this code can hurt you, because it was one of my firsts projects, so that is why it is trash code (for example "many if's" instead of "switch", etc.)

Very simple Discord bot, if you just download the code it won't work, you have to read Discord Developer Portal https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro and make your own app, then copy key, and other things. This bot is really stupid, it was rather a joke for my discord server with friends.
